# M2T

Land currency by the number of land area 510.072.000.000 M2T

Buying, selling and renting

Currency leasing enjoys the owner of tokens with a number of M2T and the property remains for the original owner

The owner of the tokens has the ability to build his own real project in the world of M2Earth in the most beautiful places in the world and use your product, marketing and extraction through a decentralized platform EXCHANGE M2T

\*The process that we will do in the lease, which is to make a contract that will temporarily lock and transfer the required percentage from the lessor to the owner of the contract for the enjoyment of two parties will apply to NFTs

Each **M2Earth** transaction charges a **10% fee**, thereby distributing **5% of the fee to M2Earth holders,** while the other **5% fee is further split in two**.From the percentage that is split in two, half is sold by a smart contract into BNB (Binance Coin) while the other half is automatically paired to BNB and added to [PancakeSwap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-pancakeswap)'s liquidity pool.&#x20;

With this mechanism, the fans who hold onto the token are rewarded with static rewards, while those who sell their **M2Earth** tokens are disincentivized for continuous selling. Overall, this stabilizes the token's price and funds the project's liquidity.

#### Static Rewards  <a href="#static-rewards" id="static-rewards"></a>

Static rewards are the **5% tokens distributed to M2Earth holders**. The amount distribution is based on the volume of tokens traded as the 5% is a part of the 10% fee charged on every transaction. This helps solve the downward sell pressure that is often the case when early adopters sell their tokens.

#### Manual Burn <a href="#manual-burn" id="manual-burn"></a>

This feature implements a token burn strategy for M2Earth such that the supply of tokens reduces to increase its price and demand.&#x20;

#### Automatic Liquidity Pool <a href="#automatic-liquidity-pool" id="automatic-liquidity-pool"></a>

**M2Earth** features a **self-sustaining liquidity pool** that sucks up tokens from transactions in the form of fees and adds them to **M2Ts** liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. This adds a solid price floor for the token. It also penalizes selling activities, thereby discouraging M2Tfrom dumping the token in the markets.

### M2Earth <a href="#safeearn" id="safeearn"></a>

In addition to the gains that **M2Earth** holders benefit from simply [HODL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hodl)-ing the SafeMoon token, users get to earn more incentives with M2Earth. **M2Earth** is a **newly launched decentralized application** on the Binance Smart Chain network that allows **M2Earth holders to stake their M2Earth token (or convert them into M2T tokens) and automatically earn more M2T**
