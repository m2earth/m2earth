In general, this stabilizes the price of the token and finances the liquidity of the project.

#### Static Rewards  <a href="#static-rewards" id="static-rewards"></a>

Static rewards are the **5% tokens distributed to M2Earth holders**. The amount distribution is based on the volume of tokens traded as the 5% is a part of the 10% fee charged on every transaction. This helps solve the downward sell pressure that is often the case when early adopters sell their tokens.

#### Manual Burn <a href="#manual-burn" id="manual-burn"></a>

This feature implements a token burn strategy for **M2T** such that the supply of tokens reduces to increase its price and demand.&#x20;

#### Automatic Liquidity Pool <a href="#automatic-liquidity-pool" id="automatic-liquidity-pool"></a>

M2Earth features a self-sustaining liquidity pool that sucks up tokens from transactions in the form of fees and adds them to M2Ts liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. This adds a solid price floor for the token.
